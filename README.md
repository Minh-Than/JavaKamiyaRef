# Standalone Kamiya Reference Finding Tool

_This project is an attempt to create a non-browser version of an existing reference finding tool created by **Satoshi Kamiya**. You can find the original link [here](https://www.folders.jp/reference/reference.html)._

### TODO List:
- [ ] Fix preferred ratio not being taken into results' orderings
- [x] Implement the flags *(mostly works but not completely for some reason)*
- [x] Show the current result index somewhere
- [x] Clear results to empty the panel *(Optional)*
- [ ] Dynamically draw reference images base on decimal and direction instead of just finding and slapping resource images *(Optional but super cool and difficult)*
